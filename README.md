## Feature Overview

![showcase](./media/showcase.gif?raw=true)

Leap lets you jump to any location in the visible editor area by entering a two-character search pattern and then possibly a tag character to select your destination from multiple matches.

The default key assignment to open the Leap widget is `Ctrl + Alt + F` and with `Alt + C` you can toggle the "Match Case" option.

## Extension Settings

The ability to select a custom keymap is planned for future releases.

## Known Issues

None, but feel free to report any bugs you may find :)
